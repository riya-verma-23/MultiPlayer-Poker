### Project Introduction
  
  We want to make a fun and interactive poker simulation that tells the player their hand's ranking and score. Our goal is to eventuaoly provide a entertaining platform for poker players online. We've chosen to work on this project because we love to play poker and work through its theories and complexities.

### Please provide a brief description of your project. List the goals and objectives of your project and explain why you’ve chosen to work on this project. 

#### System Overview
  System to Deal, Rank, Shuffle, Distribute Cards

### Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.

 Create a card.rs which generates and prints cards followed by deck.rs which deals with shuffling and dealing. Lastly, create functions checking for each hand ranking and scoring them in a hierarchal manner.

### Please list some of the challenges you foresee running into.

Scoring the hand might get tough considering the many possibilities of a tie breaker. Also, printing the card "pretty" could become tedious.

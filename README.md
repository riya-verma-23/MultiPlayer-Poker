Project Introduction: We want to make a fun and interactive poker game that can be played on multiple devices. Our goal is to provide a entertaining platform for poker players online. We've chosen to work on this project because we love to play poker and work through its theories and complexities. 

System Overview: Main Features: 

System to Deal, Rank, Shuffle, Distribute Cards

Networking Component for different players/devices to send and receive messages

Description: One computer acts as the host and connects to the server which the other computers connect to. 

Possible Challenges:

Being a multiplayer game, it might be difficult for devices to interact with one another efficiently. It might be difficult to determine which devices can access a certain variable at a time and when it can be released.
